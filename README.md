# CDCL SAT Solver 

Implementation of a SAT solver using watches, restarts and clause learning. Based on the SAT Solving course of Prof. Armin Biere at Freiburg University.

To compile run `./configure && make` for optimized compilation and
`./configure --debug && make` if you want to include symbols and disable
assertion checking.  See `./configure -l` for more options.

The code is supposed to be kept formatted with `clang-format` for which
you need to install it first and then issue `make format`.

There are regression tests included, see `make test`.

- `cdcl-sat`         : the executable binary after compilation.
- `cdcl-sat.cpp`     : the self-contained actual C++ solver code.
- `cnfs`            : test files in DIMACS format and test runner `test/run.sh`.
- `config.hpp`      : generated by `generate` to capture build information.
- `configure`       : the `configure` script generates `makefile`.
- `generate`        : the `generate` script generates `config.hpp`.
- `LICENSE`         : the license file (currently MIT license).
- `makefile`        : the actual makefile generated from `makefile.in`.
- `makefile.in`     : the makefile template instantiated to `makefile`.
- `README.md`       : this overview file.
- `VERSION`         : the version number.
